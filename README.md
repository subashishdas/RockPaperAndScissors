# Rock Paper and Scissors

This is a Java program for playing the Rock, Paper, and Scissors game against the computer. 


## Documentation

    The user is prompted to enter their choice: 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors.

    If the user enters a number other than 0, 1, or 2, the program prints "Invalid Input" and asks the user to enter their choice again.

    The computer generates a random number between 0 and 2 to represent its choice.

    The program compares the user's choice and the computer's choice and determines the winner according to the Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:

    Rock beats Scissors
    Scissors beats Paper
    Paper beats Rock

    If the user and the computer make the same choice, it is a draw.

    The program prints the result of the game: "Hurray! You Win" if the user wins, "Better Luck Next Time! Computer Wins" if the computer wins, or "Draw!" if it is a draw.

Overall, this program provides a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java.
